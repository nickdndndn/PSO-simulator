# Particle Swarm Optimization

The goal of the program is to evaluate properties of PSO and compare PSO against gradient descent.<br />
Used simulations of the pros and cons of PSO and to find out if it makes sense to combine PSO and gradient descent.<br />

## Benchmark functions
Benchmark functions help us to understand if our algorithm works so we used:
* Rosenbrock
* Rastrigin

## Installation
The program is in Python <br />
In order to use the code you need to install the following  packages
   ```sh
    import numpy as np
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    import imageio
    import random
    import tensorflow as tf
   ```
